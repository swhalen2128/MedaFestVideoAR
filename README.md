# MedaFestVideoAR

This is a project that I created using Unity 2017 and the HololensToolkit. The build settings should be set for the Microsoft Hololens. NOTE: I am not sure if this will work in an earlier version on Unity.

For Georgetown's Media Fest, I took the videos that were submitted and placed them into textures so that when the target object received the user's gaze, the video would start playing. There is also code in the project files that didn't make it into the final product that replaced the object found with the object that contained the video. 

There are 7 Video Objects in the scene. The 3D text objects are there to provide information to the Media Fest visitors to when and where those videos were being screened.
